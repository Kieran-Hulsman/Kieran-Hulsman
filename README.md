### Hi, I'm Kieran :love_you_gesture:

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student at Waterloo. 

In September, I started my 3rd co-op at Bank of America, working as a Software Developer on the Prime Brokerage Risk Team.

My last co-op was at Ollon, a Toronto-based startup. I walked in with essentially zero full-stack development experience, and by the end of my 4 month term, I'd written 20,000 lines of production-level code. 

I'm currently seeking Summer 2025 internship opportunities.
